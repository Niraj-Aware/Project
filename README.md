# Project
Final Year B.E Project

To compare the performance of the three algorithms (BoW, tf-idf, and fuzzywuzzy) on the Quora dataset, you can use the following code to create a bar chart showing their accuracy:

1.Reads in the Quora training data from a CSV file, using only sample data.

2.Defines the labels for the data.

3.Applies the BoW, tf-idf, and fuzzywuzzy approaches to the data, and trains a Random Forest classifier on each approach.

4.Calculates the accuracy of each approach.

5.Plots a bar chart comparing the accuracy of each approach.

After the comparative analysis we choose the best approach algorithm to create the model that predicts the duplicate question on basis of trained ML model.
